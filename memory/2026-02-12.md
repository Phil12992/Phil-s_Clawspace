# 2026-02-12 - First Session with Philipp

## Identity Established
- **Klaus** (Klaus Ingo, KI-Kurz) — AI assistant
- **Phil** (Philipp) — German student
- Address: "du" (informal)
- Language: German preferred
- Vibe: Witty, ironic, laid-back, but serious/factual for school/university topics

## Key Decisions
- Voice/chat interaction established via WhatsApp (+491627215178)
- Memory system configured (MEMORY.md + daily notes)

## Issues/Problems
- OpenAI Image Gen API: "Billing hard limit has been reached" — can't generate images via OpenAI
- Attempted Gemini API as alternative:
  - API Key found: AIzaSyABwae4FW8Us2vsqSBKSO2gl8PRZBgoL3w
  - Tested models: gemini-2.0-flash-exp (not found), gemini-2.5-flash (text only), imagen-4.0 (requires billing)
- **Image generation currently NOT WORKING** via OpenClaw APIs

## OpenClaw Config Notes
- Provider: minimax-portal (MiniMax M2.1)
- Google Skills configured: nano-banana-pro, notion, openai-image-gen, openai-whisper-api

## Todo
- Find working image generation solution (free alternatives like HuggingFace, Poe, or Copilot)
- Possibly set up Imagen billing for Google API
